      <description>During my PhD in neuropsychopharmacology, I:
 wrote grant proposal and was awarded with the grant Preludium11 funded by National Science Centre, Poland, making this project possible collected data by perfoming patch-clamp experiments, in which I recorded neuronal signals from single neurons in the amygdala circuit wrote MATLAB scripts to detect spikes from neuronal electrical signal and analyze their parameters (frequency, width, and amplitude) developed my own R package using devtools to wrange, analyze, and visualize my data (tidyverse, ggplot2) utilized Rmarkdown to produce automated analysis and reports, which helped me to plan further experiments used bookdown to wrote my PhD thesis both as a github book and pdf learned how to communicate my research findings by presenting them at 18 international conferences/workshops (4 talks and 14 posters) (see: Scientific activity) was able to work on multiple projects (see: Scientific activity)   Link to my PhD thesis (github book)</description>

      <description>In this Jupyter Notebook I used Exponential-Integrate and Fire neuron model to measure such neuronal parameters as firing frequency and coefficient of variation (CV) Parameters were chosen based on my PhD data and/or scientific literature By using interactive widgets, the relationship between the amount of injected current and neuronal response can be easily visualized Models were written utilizing numpy and pandas and results were visualized with matplotlib and seaborn Simulations were run either due to fixed input (amount of external current) or external Poisson processes Models consist of a single neuron, a feedforward neuronal population or recurrent neuronal populations used nbQA and Black to beautify Python code   Link to github</description>
